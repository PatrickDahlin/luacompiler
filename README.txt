LUA Compiler written in C
-Patrick Dahlin

This is an experiment in writing a parser-lexer and llvm-emitter for compiling down lua to an executable.

Currently parsing and lexing is somewhat complete and machine code emitting is on the TODO list

Working on it on my spare time so may or may not ever get finished but at least it can be used for learning purposes :P


Also, memory management is not a known word around here, I shall however research this thing when I have a proof of concept compiler working :D
